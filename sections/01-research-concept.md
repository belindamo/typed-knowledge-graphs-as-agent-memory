# Research Concept & Direction

Research Problem & Objectives:
Investigating typed knowledge graphs as superior memory retrieval systems. Two primary research questions: (1) Why are typed knowledge graph structures better for memory retrieval compared to vector search and graph RAG? (2) How can emergent ontologies be discovered from unstructured text using typed knowledge graph structures?
Knowledge Gap:
Limited comparative analysis of memory retrieval systems, particularly typed knowledge graphs versus current state-of-the-art methods. Insufficient exploration of emergent ontology discovery.
Research Goals:

Benchmark typed knowledge graphs against existing memory systems
Develop emergent ontology discovery methodologies
Create performance metrics for memory retrieval comparison
Advance understanding of structured vs. unstructured knowledge representation

Scope: Comparative analysis using existing kgmem repository with extension to ontology discovery
Expected Contributions: Memory system performance benchmarks, emergent ontology discovery methods
